# Master Requested-Work Backlog (durable record)

Single authoritative list of everything the user has asked for. Started 2026-07-03.
Keep this current as items land or new ones arrive.

**Standing directive (2026-07-04):** capture each idea the moment it's given → durable
record here → work through them in phases (investigate → spec → TDD build → deploy+verify).
Don't block momentum by fully implementing each before capturing the next.

## ✅ PLANNING DECISIONS — 2026-07-05 (buy-plan epic G–K · prospecting O · hover C)

**Buy-plan epic (G–K):**
- **G** list rows show **customer, Revenue, Sales GP, part numbers** (display; Rev/GP derived from line sell/cost).
- **H** "Create Buy Plan" button (confirm at build: from-scratch vs seeded from a requisition/SO).
- **I edit gate:** BEFORE approval, sales OR manager can edit (change vendor / add-remove lines / qty / price); AFTER approval, **MANAGER-ONLY** edits (sales locked out). **No re-approval trigger** — the manager's edit authority IS the control (respects "leave Approvals unchanged").
- **J** salesperson enters the active **SO number**, editable at any non-terminal stage.
- **K Cancel** (sales) → `Cancelled`, **reason required**; **Halt** (manager) → paused, **reason required**, **manager can resume** → Active. Completed/Cancelled are locked (no edits).

**Prospecting O:**
- Pool = unassigned accounts. Rep actions = **Claim** (→ assigned to self, moves to CRM) + **Dismiss**. Remove the general Reclaim/Reassign from the pool grid.
- **Manager-only "Assign"** action → pick ANY rep → assigns the account to that rep (moves to CRM under them). This **subsumes the sweep "put-it-back"** (a manager can assign a swept account to any rep incl. the original), preserving the 45d/30d sweep policy.
- Claim/Assign → account leaves prospecting, appears on CRM/Customers owned by the assignee.

**Score/price hover (C):**
- **Header hover** → static definition of the metric.
- **Value hover (score)** → deterministic **factor breakdown** (actual weighted drivers + contributions; instant, free, exact — NO AI).
- **Value hover (historic price)** → the real price-history sparkline/list.
- Applies across score + historic-price columns (buyer-ready / avail / multiplier / vendor / sighting / prospect; part & material price history). Build note: expose each score's factor breakdown (persist/surface where a score doesn't already).

## 🆕 NEW REQUESTS — 2026-07-04 (requisition-lifecycle theme; capture + phase)

| # | Idea | Decision / scope | Status |
|---|------|------------------|--------|
| A | **Sales Hub — no Archive on selected part-lines; Mark Won / Mark Lost instead** | Replace the bulk **Archive** in the parts-workspace selection bar (`parts/list.html` bulk bar `:66-85`; JS `:277-322`; `bulk_archive` at `routers/htmx/parts.py:1050`) with **Mark Won** + **Mark Lost**. ✅ **User-confirmed decisions:** (1) resolve at the **part-line level** — each selected `Requirement` gets `SourcingStatus.WON`/`LOST` via `requirement_status.transition_requirement` (status_machine allows open/sourcing/offered/quoted→won/lost); (2) **capture a required "why won / why lost" reason** — ONE shared reason prompt (mirror the `req_row.html` outcome popover) applied to all selected lines. NEEDS a **migration: add `Requirement.outcome_reason` (nullable Text)** (`models/sourcing.py:128`; today only `Requisition` has it at `:66`). New endpoint (e.g. `POST /v2/partials/parts/bulk-outcome` `{requirement_ids, outcome, reason}`) → 400 on blank reason. Keep the archived-view Unarchive; only the default bulk **Archive action** is removed. | ✅ Specced — ready to build |
| B | **New Requisition — "Hot List" option** | Add a **Hot List** toggle to the New-Requisition modal (`requisitions/unified_modal.html`, near hidden metadata `:422-429`). ✅ **User-confirmed: Hot List = `HOTLIST` monitor** (stored + market-data + proactive matches, NOT sourced/archived). Build: add `hotlist: bool = Form(False)` to `requisition_import_save` (`routers/htmx/requisitions.py:463`, set `status=HOTLIST` at `:544`); **also set `Requisition.company_id` from the chosen site** (create path omits it today → proactive match query needs it — `proactive_matching.py:205` filters `status==HOTLIST` + joins Company). No auto-source suppression needed (create has no kickoff; search queue is `OPEN_PIPELINE`-scoped). Add a **"Hot List" filter pill** to the requisitions list (`requisitions/list.html:144`) so created monitor deals are visible (additive UI — necessary for the feature). | ✅ Specced — ready to build |
| C | **Hover explanations on scored / historic-price columns** | A **two-tier hover** UX wherever a **score** or **historic price** is shown: (1) hover the **column header** (e.g. "Score") → a **definitional tooltip** explaining what that metric means / how it's computed; (2) hover the **value itself** → contextual detail — for a **score**, an **AI blurb explaining why *this row* scored that way** (its specific drivers); for **historic pricing**, show the **price history** (past prices — list / sparkline / mini-chart). Apply across all score + historic-price columns (buyer-ready / avail / multiplier / vendor / sighting / prospect scores; part & material-card price history). **Build-time decisions:** AI blurb **on-demand vs precomputed** (hover-triggered AI = latency + cost + rate-limit — likely cache/precompute or lazy-load with a spinner); exact column inventory; reuse the existing hover-tooltip + `record_price_snapshot`/PartHistory data. | Captured |

| D | **Sightings detail panel — fix top whitespace + declutter vendor list** | On `/v2/sightings` the **right-hand detail panel** (selected part, e.g. ESP32-WROVER-E) is unbalanced: the **top wastes vertical space** (part header + QTY / TARGET / CUSTOMER / STATUS block is sparse/loose) while the **lower Vendors list feels busy + cluttered** (19 rows, each = vendor + "Sighting" chip + "Also on N other reqs" + qty / best-price / score / Build RFQ). Design pass (frontend-design, `templates/htmx/partials/sightings/` detail template): tighten/condense the top header to reclaim the wasted space, and declutter the vendor rows — stronger visual hierarchy, less noise, make qty/price/score scannable. Ties into idea **C** (score/price hover) on this same Vendors table. | Captured |

| E | **Material Card detail page — tighten + clean (too much wasted space)** | `/v2/materials/{id}` (e.g. 4XB7A17133 — "SSD, ThinkSystem…"): the page is mostly **empty/sparse with large vertical gaps** — Specifications (Category / Package / Pin Count / Lifecycle, many `--`), "No pricing data available", "No alternative parts discovered yet", Insights — everything spread out with wasted space. Condense: tighter section spacing, denser spec grid, compact empty states, so the page reads clean + purposeful instead of empty. (frontend-design; materials detail template under `templates/htmx/partials/` — pin exact file at build.) | Captured |

| F | **Search / part-dossier page — tighten wasted space (feels unfinished)** | `/v2/search?mpn=…` (e.g. MAEQ-23664C, MACOM): a large **empty gap in the center** between the part title + "WHAT WE KNOW" / MARKET-PRICE header and the "Live market" section; the layout "feels unfinished and inefficient." Condense the header/action zone, close the dead vertical gap, make the dossier read complete + purposeful. (frontend-design; `templates/htmx/partials/search/` dossier incl. `dossier_hero.html`.) | Captured |

| G | **Approvals · Buy Plans / Sales Orders list — add customer, Rev, Sales GP, part numbers** | On `/v2/approvals` → Buy Plans / Sales Orders list, each row shows only Plan # + subtitle + status badge + value + View. Add per row: **customer name**, **Revenue (Rev)**, **Sales GP** (gross profit — $ and/or %), and the **part numbers (MPNs) on the plan**. Source from `BuyPlan` (customer + line-item sell/cost → Rev + GP) and its line-item MPNs. (buy-plans list template + list-context query under `templates/htmx/partials/approvals|buy_plans/`.) | Captured |

| H | **Approvals · "Create Buy Plan" button** | On the Buy Plans / Sales Orders list (`/v2/approvals`) add a **Create / New Buy Plan** button to *start* the buy-plan process — there's no create affordance there today (only View on existing plans). At build: confirm whether a create-buy-plan flow already exists (e.g. spun up from a requisition / sales order) that this button should launch, vs building a net-new entry point + form. Pairs with **G** (same list). | Captured |

| I | **Buy Plan editing — sales + manager can modify** | Both the **salesperson** and the **manager** role must be able to **edit a buy plan**: change the **vendor** per line, **add / remove lines**, change **qty**, **price**, etc. (Check today: is the buy plan read-only / role-restricted / status-gated after creation?) Build: an editable buy-plan line UI (add/remove rows, per-line vendor picker, qty/price inputs) + save endpoints, with edit access granted to **both** sales AND manager roles. **Build-time decisions:** which lifecycle statuses stay editable (Draft/Active/Pending — probably lock once Completed/Cancelled) and whether an edit **re-triggers / invalidates the approval** (money-governing → likely re-approve on material change). Pairs with G/H (Approvals · buy plans). | Captured |

| J | **Salesperson field for the active Sales Order number** | The salesperson needs an editable **field to enter the active/actual Sales Order (SO) number** on the buy plan / sales order — the real order number once the deal is placed. (Plans already surface "SO …" in their subtitle, e.g. "Plan #10 - SO TS00190738", so a SO-number field likely already exists on `BuyPlan`.) Build: expose/add an editable SO-number field the **salesperson** can set on the plan (detail + edit form), and show it in the Approvals list (ties into **G**). Build-time: confirm the existing field name vs new column; edit access = sales (+ manager per **I**). Pairs with G/H/I. | Captured |

| K | **Buy Plan lifecycle actions — Cancel (sales) + Halt (manager)** | On a buy plan, add role-gated actions: the **salesperson** gets a **Cancel** function (→ `Cancelled`); the **manager** gets a **Halt** function (→ `Halted`). Both statuses already exist (the Approvals list shows Cancelled + Halted badges). Build: a Cancel button gated to sales, a Halt button gated to manager, each transitioning the plan status with the right guards. Pairs with G/H/I/J. **Build-time:** confirm the BuyPlan status enum's cancelled/halted transitions; whether Cancel/Halt require a reason; what Halt does downstream (pause the approval / any open POs?). Respect the "leave Approvals/separation-of-duties unchanged" rule — these are plan-owner/manager actions, not approval-gate changes. | Captured |

| L | **Resell tab — top tiles too big (waste vertical space)** | On the Resell tab (`/v2/resell`), the tiles/stat cards at the **top are oversized** and waste vertical space, pushing the working content down. Shrink/condense them (tighter padding, smaller stat cards, less chrome) to reclaim vertical space. (frontend-design; resell tab template under `templates/htmx/partials/resell/` — pin exact file at build.) Part of the app-wide **density/whitespace** theme (with D/E/F). | Captured |

| M | **CRM Accounts toolbar — move "+ New account" next to "+ Save view"** | On the CRM Customers/Accounts page (`/v2/customers`), "+ New account" sits on its **own row** below the VIEWS / "+ Save view" row, adding toolbar height. Move **"+ New account" onto the same row as "+ Save view"** (single toolbar row) to minimize the bar height. (frontend-design; customers list header/toolbar — `templates/htmx/partials/customers/_account_list.html` or the list header.) Part of the density theme. | Captured |

| N | **Prospect tab — tighten top bar (cleaner, no wasted space)** | On the Prospecting tab, the **top bar is too tall / wastes space**; tighten + clean it (condense to a single toolbar row, less padding). (frontend-design; prospecting tab header.) Part of the density theme (with D/E/F/L/M). | Captured |
| O | **Prospecting = Claim or Dismiss only; claimed → CRM, owned by claimer** | The Prospecting pool = **unassigned accounts** any salesperson can dig through and grab. **Per-account actions are ONLY Claim + Dismiss** — **remove Reclaim + Reassign** from the prospecting UI (the `/v2/partials/prospects` reclaim/reassign endpoints gated in Wave 2 → drop/hide from the pool). On **Claim**: the account **leaves prospecting and appears on the CRM (Customers) tab, assigned/owned by the claiming user**. On **Dismiss**: drops from the pool (existing dismiss). **Build-time:** (1) verify claim already sets `account_owner_id`/creates the CRM `Company` — may partially work; confirm it shows in CRM under the claimer + leaves the pool; (2) **RECONCILE with the earlier account-sweep policy** ([[project_multiuser_authz_2026_06_23]] / the 45d-park + "only manager can put it back within 30d" decision) — is the manager "put it back" an alert-driven flow that survives, or does removing Reclaim/Reassign kill it? Confirm intent before deleting those endpoints. | Captured |

| P | **Sightings Board — Bulk Export CSV button** | `GET /v2/sightings/export` (sightings router) mirroring the board's active filters, querying ALL matching `Sighting` rows (no pagination), streaming CSV via `StreamingResponse` (`Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="sightings_export.csv"`, `text/csv`), same auth as the board route. Frontend: an **"Export CSV"** button in the board toolbar — a plain `<a hx-boost="false">` (not HTMX) forwarding the current filter query-string so it downloads without navigating. **Adapt columns to the REAL `Sighting` model** (MPN / manufacturer / vendor / qty / price / condition / source / seen-date / coverage — this app is electronic-component sightings, NOT species/location). | 🔵 building |

**🔎 PROACTIVE AUDIT (2026-07-04): 46 common-sense findings** — full checklist + build status in `docs/superpowers/2026-07-04-common-sense-audit-findings.md` (9 HIGH: 4 dead controls + 5 slow-sync hangs; 19 MED; 18 LOW). Being built in waves: dead-controls → slow-sync→background → CSV exports → empty states → toolbars/density.

**🐞 BUGS FOUND 2026-07-04 (jump the design queue):**
- **"Enrich not working" = actually a 30-SECOND synchronous request.** Verified live: the click returns **200** (button isn't dead) but `enrich_material` (`routers/htmx/materials.py:1040`) runs `enrich_cards` + `enrich_card_specs` **inline** (~30s: web extraction + authoritative ladder + spec pass) before swapping the page → looks hung. **Fix: enqueue a background enrichment job + return immediately**; the existing `materials/enrich_status.html` self-poller already exists to show progress. Also: when a source is disabled (Explorium 401 / Nexar+BrokerBin down) it returns a "couldn't complete" toast — also reads as broken.
- **"Insights not working"** — returns **200 fast** (works server-side); the button swaps into `#insights-panel` lower on the page. Verify it visibly updates + isn't rendering an empty panel for sparse cards (may just be scrolled below the fold / thin content).
- **(pre-existing, flagged by Wave 3)** `ownership_service.check_and_claim_open_account` is uncalled despite its docstring saying activity_service auto-invokes it on every logged activity → probable missing-wiring bug. Investigate separately.

Items A/B = requisition-lifecycle. **G–K = the Buy Plan / Sales Order lifecycle epic** (build together, short design pass first). **C = cross-cutting score/price hover layer.**

**D + E + F + L are the SAME systemic complaint** — surfaces waste vertical space / feel sparse-or-unfinished (D = Sightings right panel, E = Material Card page, F = Search dossier, L = Resell top tiles). Four reports in one walkthrough ⇒ **fix at the ROOT**: the app's default section/card padding + spacing scale is too generous. Treat as **ONE app-wide "density" pass** — tighten the shared spacing tokens / card + section-header components (root cause, not per-page band-aids per the no-band-aids rule), define compact empty-states, then apply + audit every list/detail/dossier surface. Good candidate for a Workflow (audit surfaces → apply consistent fix → verify). Build in Fable, deploy+verify to staging.

## 🔵 IN PROGRESS

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| **API-search core sprint** (full program, Phases 0-4) — the product's central function; user mandate: highly functional, optimized, stable | Phase 0 DONE (streaming-search aggregate deadline + telemetry, Test-all concurrency/timeout, keyless-Test real-path, Retry-After cap 300→30s); **deploying + SSE-verifying now**. Phases 1-4 queued. Audit: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-03-api-search-core-audit.md. **Cadence: deploy+verify EACH phase to staging.** |

## ⭐ QUEUED — user-requested module review/rework programs (after the API-core sprint)

Each = deep review → prioritized findings → optimization + rework. Treat like the
prepayment + API-search reviews (Fable multi-lens audit workflow → action plan → build).

| Item | Scope |
|------|-------|
| **Resell module** — workflow / function / process review + optimization + improvement + rework | /v2/resell, migrations 127-133; end-to-end resell flow (offer→buyers→award→…) |
| **Prospecting module** — same treatment as Resell | prospecting workflow/function/process review + optimize + rework |
| **Tasks module** — same treatment as Resell | tasks workflow/function/process review + optimize + rework |
| **CRM aesthetics / readability** pass | Customers/Contacts/Companies + detail panels: easier to read, more pleasing, important info stands out WITHOUT being noise — clean + effective. Visual hierarchy, signal-vs-noise. (frontend-design; targeted taste sweep) |
| **Trouble-ticket "Report a Problem" data entry** — cleanup + simplification + optimization | the Report-a-Problem modal (app/templates/htmx/partials/shared/trouble_report_form.html): lots of empty space (big blank auto-screenshot box), tighten/simplify the form |
| **Sightings page — hide won/lost/archived deals** (quick fix) | The sightings page is for buyers to ACTIVELY source + find offers for OPEN requirements. Won/lost/archived deals (closed requirements) must NOT appear. Filter them out of the sightings query. |

### 🧩 "Workspace grouping & collapse UX" theme (related — do together / shared pattern)
Buyers/salespeople need to group + collapse/expand + reset their working lists so they can focus on one group at a time. Build ONE reusable collapse/group pattern and apply across:
| Surface | Ask |
|---------|-----|
| **Sightings** — collapsible brand/manufacturer groups + clean/reset | Collapse groups they don't want to work on now, open the ones they do; a "clean & reset" function to reset view/groupings. (grouping already exists in the query — add collapse + reset) |
| **Sales Hub** — nested grouping customer › requisition › requirement lines | Requirement lines grouped by requisition, requisitions grouped by customer (2-level). Easy expand/collapse (and/or filter) — cleanest, most efficient structure. |

## 🧑 USER-SIDE (yours, not code — whenever)

- SFDC data import (no near-term date); March enrichment recovery (SFDC Weekly Export).
- Launch config: disable password login after Microsoft sign-in; DO Spaces backup creds;
  set the 3 prepayment notification config keys; the datasheet SharePoint site + Sites.Selected.
- Explorium API key + eBay client id/secret (deferred — those 2 dormant features await keys).

## 📌 STANDING DECISIONS / DIRECTIVES (apply to all work)

- **Leave Approvals / separation-of-duties UNCHANGED** (explicit).
- **Future ERP = Microsoft Dynamics 365** (round-2 project post-go-live) — NOT QuickBooks
  (Desktop-in-Azure, un-connectable). Reconciliation targets Dynamics. See
  [[reference_quickbooks_desktop_azure]].
- **Deploy + verify EACH phase** to staging as we go; **clean up afterwards** (git/artifacts).
- **Use Fable** for build subagents.
- **Ask clarifying questions ONE AT A TIME** with a Recommended option (codified in CLAUDE.md).
- Money-governing + core code: TDD, migrations round-tripped on throwaway PG, full suite
  (`SENTRY_DSN=""`), live-verify (curl ≠ htmx — headless drive the real surface).
